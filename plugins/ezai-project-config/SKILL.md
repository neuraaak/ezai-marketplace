Project toolchain, configuration, and infrastructure standards. Load the language file from the routing table below, then load `references/common/config.md` for cross-language infrastructure principles.

## Language routing

| Language                | File                                        |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Python                  | `references/languages/python/config.md`     |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `references/languages/javascript/config.md` |

For monorepos using both, load both language files and apply each to its respective subdirectory. If a file is unavailable, notify the user with: "I could not locate [filename]. Please provide it or confirm the language."
