Testing, security, and quality standards. Load the language file from the routing table below, then load `references/common/quality.md` for cross-language principles.

## Language routing

| Language                | File                                        |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Python                  | `references/languages/python/quality.md`     |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `references/languages/javascript/quality.md` |

For mixed repos, load both language files and apply each to its respective files. If a file cannot be read, notify the user and fall back to `references/common/quality.md`.
